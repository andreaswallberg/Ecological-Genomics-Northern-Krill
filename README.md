# Ecological-Genomics-Northern-Krill
This repository contais scripts and code used to perform genome assembly and population genomics analyses of the Northern krill.

Some of these scripts and tools are study-specific (e.g. processing of repeats) whereas others are general-purpose (e.g. processing of FASTA files, genome-masking and population genetics tools). Hints are given in the descriptions.

Unless stated otherwise, all scripts assume that the tab character separate fields in tabular text files (even when the file ending says "csv").
