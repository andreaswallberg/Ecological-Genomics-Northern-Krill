# Ecological-Genomics-Northern-Krill
This repository contais scripts and code used to perform genome assembly and population genomics analyses of the Northern krill.

Some of these scripts and tools are study-specific (e.g. processing of repeats) whereas others are general-purpose (e.g. genome-masking and population genetics tools). Hints are given in the descriptions.
